## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

This is my second challenge I've completed from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home). This challenge was definetley harder than my last, [Frontend Mentor QR Code Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/first-frontend-mentor-solution-qr-code-XI2krirNVU). Through this challenge I learned that I have a lot of room to grown in flexbox and responsive design. 


### Continued development

What I plan to fix in the future on this challenge:
- Lack of responsive design (EX. Circle that changes dimensions oddly, No Mobile friendly View)
- Alignemnt issues under the "Summary" Section
